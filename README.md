### Scope

For users, the site owner wanted to achieve a website that is welcoming and unambigious. From the moment 
the user visits the website it is clear that this is a memory game website based on the American Comedy Series "The Office". 
The user will also have the option to contact the site owner should 
they wish to do so and this can be done using the contact form or through one of the social media platforms. 

### Structure

In order to meet the expectation of the "The Office" users the wesbite aims to stick to convention in
it's layout and architecture. 

There is a Header section on each page, with  "The Office" logo. Clicking on this logo will 
take the user back to the landing page of the wesbite and this is, as mentioned above, an expected and understood convention. 
There is a navbar within this header element, the navbar appears in a horizontal fashion, encouraging the user to 
explore and easily showcasing what is available and what this website is about. This makes all elements of the website
easily discoverable and aims to ensure the user can get to their desired destination within 3 clicks. 

The colouring, theme and terminology used throughout the website is consistent.Returning visitors will know what to expect
and feel a sense of comfort when browsing the website. 

The website is interactive and provides elements of feedback to the user. This is evident in the use of

## Features

### Existing Features

* Header - the Header features on each page of the website, this allows the user to easily navigate through the website. Clicking on the Peaches & Green logo acts as 
a home button, having the other navigation links also allows the user to browse the website . As mentioned above this is a convention that users now know to expect. 

* Footer - the Footer also exists on every page and again this a convention that user have become accustomed too and therefore it was important that this was 
adhered to on this website.The footer contains the social media icons, this is an important feature as it allows the user to access and further explore the 
world of "Peaches & Green" and this is reflected in the user stories. The footer also contains a copyright feature to protect the content and the creator. 

 


### Features left to implement

* Cookies Banner pop up - this should be added to ensure complaince with legislation relating to personal data and how 
that data is managed.



## Technologies Used

* [HTML5](https://www.graycelltech.com/why-use-html-5/) was used as this is the latest Hypertext Markup Language and this is the standard language for describing the contents and appearance of Web Pages.
  All major browsers offer HTML5 support. 

* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) is used to define styles for web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used as this lends itself to quickly design and customize mobile first-sites.

* [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used to style the website fonts and ensure they complimented each other.

* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) was used as this is an open source platform for automated and ready to code development environments that blends into your existing workflow.

* [GitHub](https://github.com) was used as a hosting platform for version control.

* [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) was used to resize the images for optimum size for web use (max 798 x 1280).

* [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) was used to compress the image files.

* [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/) was used for cross browser testing.

* [Am I responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) was used to create a mock up.

* [Autoprefixer CSS online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) uses data on the popularity of browsers and support for vendor prefixes by browsers. Based on this information, it arranges and deletes the prefixes. 
It can help you get prefixes for: animations, transition, transform, grid, flex, flexbox and others.

* [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) was used to edit pages and diagnose problems quickly.
